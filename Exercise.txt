HTTP:
1.Use the native node module ‘http’ and serve a basic index.html file with ‘Hello World’ to the port 9090 in localhost
2.Enhance your server: route / will send an index.html with ‘Hello World’. Route /get will download a basic .txt file of your choosing
3.If the route is unavailable, send a 404.html file with a proper indicator
4.Asynchronous - read about it, learn it, do it.
